"""The kernel tick + the beat (spec 03 §3).

The tick is a **pure function of the ledger** — one loop, fixed interval, holds
no state (B2.2). Each pass runs, in order: (a) RECOVER stale leases, (b) fire
due CRON edges (double-fire-guarded), (c) drain due MONITORS, (d) DISPATCH wakes
capped by concurrency. Dispatch is **non-blocking**: the tick kicks each beat off
async and moves on, so one slow beat can't stall the pulse.

A **beat** (``run_beat``) rehydrates an employee, runs the one ``dream.run_task``
seam, writes a raw memory delta, lands the outcome, sets status, releases the
lock, and fires downstream wakes. Almost none of this is new logic — the locks,
the lease, the beat are dream; chorus's new code is the wake/routine tables,
assignment, ``fire_downstream_wakes``, and the outcome/DoD seam.
